        You’ll be working with your instructional team and producer to maximize students’
        - as well as your own - success in the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <strong>two primary ways that you’ll receive feedback</strong> on your class’s progress
        and your professional development as a teacher from your producer:

          Reviewing student and class data (with producer; as instructional team).
          Primarily based on student sentiment regarding their course experience (surveys),
          with a few opportunities to give feedback on concepts (exit tickets).

      <p class="fragment">
        We touched on data review as a shared responsibility between your instructional team and producer.
        It’s important to keep in mind that most classroom data discussed between instructors and producers
        is sentiment-based, meaning that students are rating their feelings regarding their classroom experience.
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        We take these types of metrics seriously as a user-driven organization,
        but we also recognize that student feedback needs to be paired with feedback from
        team members trained on instructional best practices in order to recognize and value your
        development as an instructor throughout the course.
      </p>
      <p class="fragment">
        Let’s take a look at how student sentiment metrics factor into your overall performance evaluation at GA.

        You don’t have to wait for your producer to review <strong>student data.</strong>
        As an instructional team, you’ll be the first to receive many types of student data
        (homework assignments, projects, exit tickets), and we encourage you to utilize
        the feedback avenues provided to reflect on your own teaching practice and students’
        program experience to make adjustments in real time.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">
        One of the benefits of teaching at GA is teaching in team; setting up weekly debriefs with team members,
        within or without the producer, is a long-standing best practice with our top instructional teams.

        Team members often set aside time before, after, or even outside of class to review the previous
        week’s data, including exit tickets and student performance on homework; identify materials and
        support questions they have for each other and GA; and sync on the upcoming content and events of
        the class.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">
        Instructional teams also find it helpful to complete class activities together that benefit from input and
        feedback - things like workshopping and grading student projects or planning for special class sessions.
        It’s often easier to tackle these large-class initiatives with your fellow instructors - and it makes
        the grading and feedback more consistent, too!

        Student sentiment data regarding mid- and end-of-course feedback surveys is helpful to this end.
        For part-time courses, students receive a survey at the mid and end points of a course that ask
        them broader questions about their experience.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">
        These are quite in-depth! These 50-question surveys, completed by students during 20 minutes of
        class, gauge everything from the performance of instructional team and course materials to the
        level of support and experience provided by GA.
