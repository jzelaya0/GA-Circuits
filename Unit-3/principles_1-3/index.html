        We utilize a set of six adult learning principles to guide our approach to instruction at GA.
        These principles structure everything we do, from lesson design, to instructor training, to building better products.

        The principles of adult learning theory, or

          andragogy, prescribe the types of learning activities and environments that maximize adults’ learning potential.

        GA instructors should use the following principles as a checklist when planning their lessons to ensure that their lessons align with best practices for teaching adults.

    <h1>The Basics: Adult Learning Theory</h1>

        In the 1980s, Malcolm Knowles popularized <strong>andragogy</strong> (the method and practice of teaching adult learners).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-centered">
      <p  class="fragment" data-frament-index='1'>
        The basic premise is that adults need to be <strong>active learners</strong>; they need to do in order to learn.

          <p>
            <strong>Break tasks down into simpler steps. </strong>
            This will give students a procedure to follow on their own, outside of class.

            <i>Mechanical steps </i>
            (i.e. how to use Twitter) are easier to learn on one’s own.

            <i>Strategic thinking steps </i>
            (i.e. how to determine if a Twitter campaign is right for your start up) tend
            to be more opaque because they outline how to think about a problem and are often not written down by experts,
            to whom such knowledge is routinely accessed. (i.e. Twitter gurus don’t need to write down how they determine if a campaign is right for a client).

            <strong>Suggest next steps at the end of the lesson. </strong>
            If students want to learn more or are interested in related topics, what should they do? How can they continue to self-direct their own learning?

          <p>
            <strong>Involve students to select methods, materials and resources for instruction. </strong>
            Use the beginning of the course or lesson to ask students what they are most interested in learning.
            During the course or lesson, continue to check in regarding the relevance and pace of instruction.
            Throughout the course or lesson, ask students to share their own experiences and determine as a group which examples and skills are most critical to learn.
          </p>
        </li>

    <div class="col">
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index='2'>
          <p>
            <strong>Allow for student choice. </strong>
            As often as possible, allow students to select the context, topic, industry, or company on which an assignment or project can be based.
            This enables students to capitalize on their prior knowledge.
            The result is that they’re more engaged and can extend prior and new learnings.

          <p>
            <strong>Use examples that relate to prior knowledge. </strong>
            The advantage you have with adults is that you can relate complex relationships and systems to ones they already know about,
            facilitating a quicker understanding of new material.
