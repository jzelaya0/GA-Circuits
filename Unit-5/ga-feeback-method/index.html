        Your instructor responsibilities include providing feedback and grading
        student work as part of helping students learn. You are regularly expected to provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment"  data-fragment-index='0'><strong>in-class feedback</strong> during direct instruction, lab, or workshop time</li>
        <li class="fragment"  data-fragment-index='1'><strong>written feedback</strong> on homework, projects, and presentations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fragment"  data-fragment-index='2'>
        In this unit, you’ll learn how extend this feedback loop one step further,
        by identifying how to <strong>deliver feedback in the context of feedback conversations.</strong>

        While not every student meeting involves referencing written work,
        <strong>
          attempting to have constructive
          feedback conversations without reviewing student learning data puts both the students and you at a disadvantage.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        GA strives to “bring data to the table” whenever possible, as this helps us have honest, reflective
        conversations about challenges, successes, and growth opportunities. It’s no different for you as an instructor.

        The GA Feedback Method aims to equip you with a <strong>strategy in which to address,
        follow up on, and extend written feedback on student learning data</strong> by showing you how to guide and manage
        conversations in various types of feedback scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        It emphasizes <strong>delivering feedback to encourage a growth mindset and maximize established feedback techniques</strong> within group and 1:1 settings.
